While the function of a few genes during this process has been studied, we are far from fully understanding how genes interact to coordinate heart regeneration. To enable systematic insights into this phenomenon, we generated and integrated a dynamic co-expression network of heart regeneration in the zebrafish and linked systems-level properties to the underlying molecular events. Across multiple post-injury time points, the network displays topological attributes of biological relevance. We show that regeneration steps are mediated by modules of transcriptionally coordinated genes, and by genes acting as network hubs. We also established direct associations between hubs and validated drivers of heart regeneration with murine and human orthologs. The resulting models and interactive analysis tools are available at http://infused.vital-it.ch. Using a worked example, we demonstrate the usefulness of this unique open resource for hypothesis generation and in silico screening for genes involved in heart regeneration."						Protocol Name	P-GSE67665-1	P-GSE67665-5	P-GSE67665-6	P-GSE67665-2	P-GSE67665-3	P-GSE67665-4	P-GSE67665-7Protocol Description	Microarray data were pre-processed by Partekí‰Œ¬ Genomics Suite version 6.5 using the robust multi-chip analysis (RMA) [Irizarry et.al. 2003] with GC-content correction. ID_REF =  VALUE = Normalized log2 intensities	"250 ng of total RNAs were reverse transcribed into cDNA, then transcribed into cRNAs and labeled into biotinylated cRNA using the GeneChip WT Reagent kit (Affymetrix) according to the manufacturerí¢ŒóŒ»s standard protocols (P/N 4425209 Rev.B and P/N 702808 Rev.6)"	"Arrays were hybridized, washed and stained using the Affymetrix GeneChip WT Terminal Labeling and Hybridization kit."	"Cryoinjury was performed as described previously [Gonzalez-Rosa et.al. 2012]. Animals were sacrificed at different time-points after surgery, from 4h to 90 days, by immersion in 0.16% tricaine (Sigma Aldrich, Bornem, BE). Hearts were dissected in PBS containing 2U/mL heparin and 0.1M KCl, then 5 heart ventricles were pooled in TRIzolí‰Œ¬ (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for RNA extraction. Hearts of uninjured fish served as control."	Experiments were conducted with adult zebrafish between 10 and 11 months old.	Extraction was performed as previously described in [Rodius at al. 2014]	GeneChip Scanner 3000 according to the manufacturer standard procedure (P/N 702731 Rev 3)Protocol Software							Protocol Hardware							Protocol Contact							Protocol Type	normalization data transformation protocol	labelling protocol	hybridization protocol	sample treatment protocol	growth protocol	nucleic acid extraction protocol	array scanning protocolProtocol Term Source REF							Protocol Term Accession Number							SDRF File	REGENE18.sdrf.txt						Term Source Name	EFO	The MGED Ontology					Term Source File	http://www.ebi.ac.uk/efo/	http://mged.sourceforge.net/ontologies/MGEDontology.php					Term Source Version							Comment [BlastDbName]							Comment[RnaSegmentAccessionSource]	ENS						Comment [ArrayExpressAccession]	E-GEOD-67665						Comment [GEOAccession]	GSE67665						Comment [RegenAccession]	REGENE:18
